# Adamite Documentation

Code for the Adamite documentation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run all of the main Create React App scripts such as "npm run build" and "npm run test" but the two main, important scripts are:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

This command will build the project and push it to our live website at [adamite.net](https://adamite.net). Only run when you are satisfied with the documentation.
